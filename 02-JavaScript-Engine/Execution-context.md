# Execution Context

In JavaScript, the execution context for a piece of code (like a function or the global code) goes through two main phases: the **creation phase** and the **execution phase**. Let's break these down a bit for clarity:

### 1. Creation Phase
During the creation phase, before the code is actually executed line by line, JavaScript does a few important things:

-   **Hoisting:** This is where the JavaScript engine "moves" declarations of functions and variables (declared with `var`) to the top of their respective scopes. For functions, the entire function definition is hoisted, meaning you can call a function before its declaration in the code. For variables declared with `var`, only the name is hoisted, and they are initialized with `undefined` until the code execution reaches their actual declaration where they are assigned a value.
    
-   **Scope Chain Establishment:** The engine figures out the scope chain for the variables, which determines the accessibility of variables based on where they are declared.
    
-   **`this` Keyword Setup:** The value of the `this` keyword is determined.
    

### 2. Execution Phase

After the creation phase, the execution phase begins. This is where the JavaScript engine executes the code line by line. Now, thanks to hoisting, all function declarations and variables declared with `var` are already known and accessible within their scope, even before the code that declares them is actually executed.


Consider the following JavaScript code snippet:
```js
function printName() {
    return 'Dominik Kotoro≈ºec';
}
function findName() {
    return printName();
}

function sayName() {
    return findName();
}
sayName();` 
```
When the JavaScript (JS) engine encounters this code, it performs several steps to execute it, primarily involving the creation and management of execution contexts. Here's a more accurate description of the process:

1.  **Global Execution Context Creation**: Before executing any code, JS creates a global execution context. This context is for variables and functions not inside any other function. It's the default or base execution context where your script starts its execution. In this context JS give us Global Object and global this
    
2.  **Execution Context for Each Function Call**: When the JS engine encounters a function call (signaled by the parentheses `()`), it creates a new execution context for that function. Each function call gets its own execution context, which includes the function's local variables, parameters, and the ability to access variables in the global context or outer functions' contexts (if any).
    
3.  **Call Stack Management**: The call stack is a LIFO (Last In, First Out) structure that tracks which execution context is currently running.
    
    -   When a function is called, its execution context is pushed onto the call stack.
    -   JS then starts executing the function body. If this function calls another function, the new function's execution context is created and pushed onto the call stack.
    -   After a function completes execution, its execution context is popped off the call stack, and control returns to the context below it on the stack.
4.  **Execution Flow in the Provided Code**:
    
    -   The `sayName()` function is called, creating its execution context and pushing it onto the call stack.
    -   Inside `sayName()`, `findName()` is called, creating a new execution context for `findName()` and pushing it onto the call stack.
    -   `findName()` then calls `printName()`, which also gets its execution context pushed onto the call stack.
    -   `printName()` returns a string, and its execution context is popped off the call stack. Control returns to `findName()`, which then also completes and gets popped off the stack.
    -   Finally, control returns to `sayName()`, which completes and gets its context popped off the call stack, leaving the global execution context.
5.  **Global Context Completion**: The global execution context is the last to be popped off the call stack when the entire script finishes executing. Unlike function execution contexts, which are created and destroyed during the script's execution, the global execution context exists throughout the life of the script.
